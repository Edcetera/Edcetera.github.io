Education is a way of exploring the world around us and trying to know it better, not just a means to find a job. At one time, there were only teachers and books that could provide information about something. With internet this has changed and education system has not yet adopted, experimented or created any new methods of teaching. 

Education should be a thing of amazement, self-discovery and self exploration and only in this way it becomes something of great interest not a compulsion. 

We all have personally experienced the above to some extent, and **Prof. Walter Lewin** of MIT summarizes this amazingly in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF-m3XZKvLI)
